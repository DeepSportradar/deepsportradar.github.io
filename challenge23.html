            <h3 class="mt-5">Challenges</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The MMSports 2022 hosted a competition with four challenges dedicated to
                Basketball named <a
                    href="http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/challenge.html">DeepSportradar 2022</a>.
                This year, the second edition has a restricted number of challenges:
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <p><b>Player instance segmentation</p></b> This challenge was the most popular from the first edition
            with results showing room for improvements. This year we will add a new and more restrictive metrics to
            better discriminate the results, specifically on occlusions. </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <p><b>Player Reidentification</p></b> Also this challenge was popular in the last edition. Moreover, our
            dataset has been listed in the <a href="https://github.com/NEU-Gou/awesome-reid-dataset">Awesome ReID
                Datasets!</a>. This year, we will add more data on the challenge set! </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <p><b>Cricket ball release detection</p></b> This challenge meets DeepSportradar objective to become a
            multisport challenge. Cricket is among the most participated sports in the world: with most participants
            coming from Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa and the UK. The International Cricket Council (ICC)
            identified that an impressive 125 countries around the world play the sport. Hence, this task is highly
            relevant for the sport analysis domain and for the video understanding domain in general.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                These three challenges portray the multisport nature of the DeepSportradar competition!</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The challenges are hosted on <a href="https://eval.ai/">EvalAI</a> where participants will submit
                the predictions of their model. Labels of the evaluation set used to rank the participants will be kept
                secret and leaderboards will display the ranking for each challenge.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Datasets</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Each challenge is based on a dataset of manually annotated images made publicly available by Sportradar.
                The proposed solutions must not use any other data than the data specifically given in the challenge
                toolkit.
                However, for neural network solutions, using a pretrained model from a well known model-zoo and trained
                on a
                public dataset is accepted, but this must be clearly stated in the submission report.
                The data destinated for evaluation cannot be used in any form for training (pseudo-labelling is
                forbidden).
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Awards</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The challenges will run in two phases described hereafter.
                Participants are allowed (and encoraged) to submit to both phases, and can compete in the three
                different challenges.
                Any team of one or multiple members can participate in the challenge but individuals can only belong to
                one single
                team per challenge. Challenge organizers cannot participate in their challenge.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">First phase -
                Compete to have your method published in the conference proceedings</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                For each challenge, the top 3 teams performing best on the leaderboard will have a 2 weeks delay to
                write a workshop paper presenting their method.
                The papers will follow a reviewing process and, upon acceptance by reviewers, will be published on the
                workshop proceedings.

                Please refer to the <a href="cfp.html">workshop call for papers</a> for submission policies.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">Second phase -
                Compete to win up to $1,000</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                For each challenge, the team performing best on the leaderboard will be awarded a $500 prize.
                In addition, a jury prize of $500 per challenge will be awarded to the team proposing the most
                innovative solution, regardless of the performance on the leaderboard.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                To be eligible, submissions must be acompagnied with a link to a public repository hosting the code to
                reproduce their results.
                The repository should also include a technical report describing the proposed approach.
                The reports and the code will be reviewed by the challenge organizers that may disqualify any submission
                for which legitimity is uncertain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The winners will be contacted one week before the workshop to prepare a 5 minutes presentation
                presenting their method.
                Their technical report and a link to their repository will be published on the challenge website.
            </p>
